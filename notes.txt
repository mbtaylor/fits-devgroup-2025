    - history, pros and cons, tools, future, culture, format, ...
    - you're going to come across FITS
 - I like FITS
 - the Pope likes FITS
     - In 2010 decision to digitise 80k documents in Vatican library using FITS

       "adoption of a unique interchange tape format to be used for
        transferring digital imagery between cooperating institutions"
       "All records will have a length of 23040 bits (2880 8-bit bytes,
        3840 6-bit bytes).  This length is evenly divisible by both
        the byte and word lengths of all computers that have been sold in
        the commercial market (i.e., 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 60 and
        64 bits)"
    - NRAO, VLA, Westerbork, Kitt Peak
    - roots a bit before, late 70s
   
 - Predictable layout of images and tables
    - memory mapping
 - Flexible Image Transport System
 - Format details
    - HDU structure
    - Header cards
    - Can't stream
       - hence VOTable
    - Primary and extension HDUs
    - Block size 2880
    - Bigendian
    - Data types (BITPIX)
    - informed by FORTRAN77
    - NULL/TNULLn, NaN
    - trailing blanks in keywords not significant
    - BSCALE/BZERO
       - originally for fp values of int data, but also e.g. flux conversion
    - ASCII CAPITALS for keywords, 7-bit ASCII for values
    - BINTABLE normally fixed-length records
    - EXTNAME
 - Once FITS forever FITS
 - Standard is readable
 - WCS - complicated but incomplete (inflexible, no combination)
 - Conventions registry
 - Slow moving, conservative
 - envy of other communities
 - data + metadata
 - FITS-plus
 - Limitations
    - NAXIS999
    - TNAME999
 - Show primary/array HDU
 - Show BINTABLE HDU
 - compression
 - tools
    - more(1) - 80 character terminal
    - vi -b
    - fitsverify
    - ftools
    - topcat/stilts - show /mbt/bigdata/gaia-dr2/gaia_source/gaia_source.colfits
    - CFITSIO
 - drawbacks
    - no versioning
    - data model
    - no namespacing
    - no association between HDUs (except EXTNAME)
 - extensions
    - HIERARCH
    - 4.2.1.2 long-string
